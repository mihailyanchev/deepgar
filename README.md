Model repository for the DeepGaR model used in the paper: Deep Growth-at-Risk Model: Nowcasting the 2020 Pandemic Lockdown Recession in Small Open Economies

The repository is organized as follows:
* data contains the raw and processed data used to obtain the results in the paper.
* results contains the charts and tables of results used in the paper.
* train contains the scripts and notebooks used to obtain the results.

The repository is a work in progress. More of the original code will be added and refactored on several iterations.
